SAMPLE 08

This sample demonstrates:
- running LWZMAKE from an ISPF environment
- this allows the use of ISPF commands in the invoked REXX's
- in this case LM routines (like LMMSTATS) in the TOUCHMEM REXX
- also the use of the $(memberlist) and $(addpdsname) functions

Try switching between ALL and CLEAN_ALL targets for conditional
and uncondition builds.
