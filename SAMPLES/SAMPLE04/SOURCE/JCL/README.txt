SAMPLE 04

This sample demonstrates:
- using variables to construct other variables
- that variable assignments with the = sign (as opposed to the := sign),
  are resolved where used
- a non-phony target, in this case an MVS data set, with a recipe that
  creates the data set

Try running it more than once to see that when the data set exists, no
recipe is performed.
