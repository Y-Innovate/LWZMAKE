<h1>What is <span class="clsMonospaceBold">make</span>?</h1>
<p>
<span class="clsMonospace">Make</span> is a utility originally from the unix/linux world used primarily for build automation. In general terms make can automatically update some files from others whenever the others change. The utility takes a script as input, written in <span class="clsMonospace">make</span>&apos;s own script language, called a <span class="clsMonospace">makefile</span>. In such a script you define <i>build targets</i>, their <i>dependencies</i> and the <i>recipes</i> to build the targets.
</p>
<p>
A basic example of the makefile syntax:
<div class="clsDivCode" style="padding: 5px 20px;"><pre>helloworld.o: helloworld.c
	gcc -c -o helloword.o helloworld.c</pre></div>
</p>
<p>
Or in a more generic form:
<div class="clsDivCode" style="padding: 5px 20px;"><pre>target: component
&lt;tab&gt;command</pre></div>
</p>
<p>
On the first sample line before the <span class="clsMonospace">:</span> is specified the file or files that share the same command line(s) to build them. In the example that's <span class="clsMonospace">helloworld.o</span>. After the <span class="clsMonospace">:</span> follow prerequisites to the building of this target, for example input files, which in turn could be targets defined elsewhere in the <span class="clsMonospace">makefile</span>.<br/>
The second line in the example defines the recipe, in this example a single line, but a recipe can contain multiple lines that each start with a recipe prefix, the default is a tab character. Each recipe line is a command line that is executed to build the target.
