<h1>Recipes</h1>
<p>
A <span class="clsMonospace">recipe</span> is the script that is executed when the evaluation of the preceding rule flagged the target to be built. Consider the following simple <span class="clsMonospace">makefile</span>:
<div class="clsDivCode" style="padding: 5px 20px;"><span class="clsLineNumber">01|</span><font color="#0000FF">.RECIPEPREFIX</font> = <font color="#0000FF">-</font>
<span class="clsLineNumber">02|</span>
<span class="clsLineNumber">03|</span><font color="#008000"># Example of a simple recipe</font>
<span class="clsLineNumber">04|</span>.PHONY SIMPLE_TARGET
<span class="clsLineNumber">05|</span><font color="#800000">SIMPLE_TARGET :</font>
<span class="clsLineNumber">06|</span>- tgt := $@
<span class="clsLineNumber">07|</span>- CALL JUSTECHO This line came from a simple target called $(tgt)
<span class="clsLineNumber">08|</span>- CALL JUSTECHO This line too and it was\
<span class="clsLineNumber">09|</span>-               continued on a second line
</div>
</p>
<p>
In this example there's one recipe on lines 06 through 09. Recipe lines begin with the recipe prefix, which was set with an assignment statement on line 01.
</p>
<p>
Only assignment statements and CALL statements are allowed, both are demonstrated above.
</p>
<h3>Delayed variable resolution</h3>
<p>
<span class="clsMonospace">zmake</span> executes a <span class="clsMonospace">makefile</span> in 2 phases. During the first phase <span class="clsMonospace">zmake</span> parses the complete makefile, putting whichever variables, rules and recipes it finds into memory in an internal format. Recipes are stored as-is, just like the prerequisites in rule statements. During the second phase targets are processed and for every target is determined whether it should be built or not. If a target is to be built, the recipe is executed and only then do variables in the recipe get resolved.
</p>
<h3>Assignments in recipes</h3>
<p>
Assignment statements in recipes work very similar to those outside of recipes. One difference was explained above, assignment statements in recipes are not executed until phase 2 and only if the processed rule flagged the target to be built.
</p>
</p>
Another difference is the use of target reference variables:
<table>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><span class="clsMonospace">$@</span></td>
		<td>Gets replaced by the current target name. If multiple targets share the same prerequisite and recipe (in other words if there are more than 1 space delimited targets before the <span class="clsMonospace">:</span> character in a rule), then <span class="clsMonospace">$@</span> contains only the target currently being processed.
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><span class="clsMonospace">$%</span></td>
		<td>Gets replaced by either the member name of the current target, if the current target is the member in a PDS, or by the file name of the current target, if the current target is the full path of a unix file. If the current target is <span class="clsMonospace">PHONY</span> then <span class="clsMonospace">$%</span> resolves to an empty string.
	</tr>
</table>
</p>
<h3>CALL statements</h3>
<p>
<span class="clsMonospace">CALL</span> statements invoke a REXX by the name directly following the CALL keyword. The REXX exec is searched in the SYSEXEC DD('s). Anything following the REXX exec name is passed as parameter after any variables have been resolved.
</p>
<p>
<b><span class="clsMonospace">zmake</span> will only continue processing if a <span class="clsMonospace">CALL</span>ed REXX returns <span class="clsMonospace">0</span></b>
</p>
<p>
<b>After all recipe statements of a target are executed <span class="clsMonospace">zmake</span> will only continue if the target that was just built actually exists (unless the target is <span class="clsMonospace">PHONY</span>).
