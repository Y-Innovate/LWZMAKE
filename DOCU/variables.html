<h1>Variables</h1>
<p>
When using <span class="clsMonospace">Make</span> you'll make heavy use of variables and it's important to know when variable resolution (replacing the variable with its value) takes place.
</p>
<p>
A <span class="clsMonospace">Make</span> variable is created by an assignment statement, some examples:
<div class="clsDivCode" style="padding: 5px 20px;"><pre># immediate assignment:
hlq    := USER1

# delayed assignment
jclds   = $(hlq).JCL

# immediate assignment, referring to a variable with delayed assignment
someds := $(jclds)

hlq     = USER2

someds := $(jclds)</pre>
</div>
Note the assignment operator <span class="clsMonospace">:=</span> which means it's an immediate assignment, or in other words, following this statement the variable myvar will contain the text 'some value'.
