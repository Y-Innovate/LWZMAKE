<h1>Variables</h1>
<p>
When using <span class="clsMonospace">zmake</span> you'll make heavy use of variables and it's important to know when variable resolution (replacing the variable with its value) takes place.
</p>
<p>
A <span class="clsMonospace">Make</span> variable is created by an assignment statement, some examples:
<div class="clsDivCode" style="padding: 5px 20px;"><font color="#008000"># immediate assignment using :=</font>
<font color="0000FF">hlq       </font>:=<font color="0000FF"> USER1</font>

<font color="008000"># delayed assignment using =
# the $(hlq) variable referred to doesn't get resolved here, but later whenever $(jclds)
# is used in another statement with immediate variable resolution</font>
<font color="0000FF">jclds      </font>=<font color="0000FF"> $(hlq).JCL</font>

<font color="008000"># immediate assignment using :=
# this statement refers to a variable with delayed assignment which means $(jclds) is
# expanded to $(hlq).JCL which then gets resolved to USER1.JCL</font>
<font color="0000FF">someds    </font>:=<font color="0000FF"> $(jclds)</font>

<font color="008000"># delayed assignment using =</font>
<font color="0000FF">hlq        </font>=<font color="0000FF"> USER2</font>

<font color="008000"># immediate conditional assignment using ?=
# a conditional assignment only assigns a value if the variable doesn't exist,
# or already exists but has no value
# this statement again refers to $(jclds) which again is expanded to $(hlq).JCL
# but since $(hlq) has been assigned a new value, the result is now USER1.JCL</font>
<font color="0000FF">anotherds </font>?=<font color="0000FF"> $(jclds)</font>
</div>
<p>
The first sample assignment is the simplest one. The immediate assignment operator <span class="clsMonospace">:=</span> causes any other variables used in the value part of the assignment to be resolved and the result assigned. Although in this first example the value is merely a constant.
</p>
<p>
The second sample assigment demonstrates the use of another variable in the value assigned. In this example the delayed assignment operator <span class="clsMonospace">=</span> is used, which means the variable <span class="clsMonospace">$(hlq)</span> is left unresolved and becomes part of the value as is.
</p>
<p>
The third sample assignment is like the first one, although this one actually demonstrates delayed variable resolution. Again the immediate assignment operator <span class="clsMonospace">:=</span> is used, resulting in any variables used in the value part of the assignment to be resolved. Furthermore this example shows that this is done recursively, so after <span class="clsMonospace">$(jclds)</span> is resolved to <span class="clsMonospace">$(hlq).JCL</span>, variable resolution will keep going since there's still a variable left. Finally the value <span class="clsMonospace">USER1.JCL</span> is assigned.
</p>
<p>
The fourth example is simple there to setup the the last example while in the meantime demonstrating that delayed assignment without using variables in the value works fine too.
</p>
<p>
The fifth sample assignment uses the immediate conditional assignment operator <span class="clsMonospace">?=</span> which causes the resolved value to only be assigned if the variable left of the operator doesn't exist or if it's empty. It also demonstrates how assigning the same <span class="clsMonospace">$(jclds)</span> variable can result in a different value because it in turn was assigned in a delayed assignment.
