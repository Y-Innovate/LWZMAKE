<h1>Variables</h1>
<p>
When using <span class="clsMonospace">zmake</span> you'll make heavy use of variables and it's important to know when variable resolution (replacing the variable with its value) takes place.
</p>
<p>
A <span class="clsMonospace">Make</span> variable is created by an assignment statement, some examples:
<div class="clsDivCode" style="padding: 5px 20px;"><font color="#008000"># immediate assignment using :=</font>
<font color="0000FF">hlq    </font>:=<font color="0000FF"> USER1</font>

<font color="008000"># delayed assignment using =
# the $(hlq) variable referred to doesn't get resolved here, but later whenever $(jclds)
# is used in another statement with immediate variable resolution</font>
<font color="0000FF">jclds   </font>=<font color="0000FF"> $(hlq).JCL</font>

<font color="008000"># immediate assignment using :=
# this statement refers to a variable with delayed assignment which means $(jclds) is
# expanded to $(hlq).JCL which then gets resolved to USER1.JCL</font>
<font color="0000FF">someds </font>:=<font color="0000FF"> $(jclds)</font>

<font color="008000"># delayed assignment using =</font>
<font color="0000FF">hlq     </font>=<font color="0000FF"> USER2</font>

<font color="008000"># immediate conditional assignment using ?=
# a conditional assignment only assigns a value if the variable doesn't exist,
# or already exists but has no value
# this statement again refers to $(jclds) which again is expanded to $(hlq).JCL
# but since $(hlq) has been assigned a new value, the result is now USER1.JCL</font>
<font color="0000FF">anotherds </font>?=<font color="0000FF"> $(jclds)</font>
</div>
Note the assignment operator <span class="clsMonospace">:=</span> which means it's an immediate assignment, or in other words, following this statement the variable myvar will contain the text 'some value'.
