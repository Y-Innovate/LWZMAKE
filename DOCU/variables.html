<h1>Variables</h1>
<p>
When using <span class="clsMonospace">zmake</span> you'll make heavy use of variables and it's important to know when variable resolution (replacing the variable with its value) takes place.
</p>
<p>
A <span class="clsMonospace">Make</span> variable is created by an assignment statement, some examples:
<div class="clsDivCode" style="padding: 5px 20px;"><span class="clsLineNumber">01|</span><font color="#008000"># immediate assignment using :=</font>
<span class="clsLineNumber">02|</span><font color="0000FF">hlq       </font>:=<font color="0000FF"> USER1</font>
<span class="clsLineNumber">03|</span>
<span class="clsLineNumber">04|</span><font color="008000"># delayed assignment using =
<span class="clsLineNumber">05|</span># the $(hlq) variable referred to doesn't get resolved here, but later
<span class="clsLineNumber">06|</span># whenever $(jclds) is used in another statement with immediate
<span class="clsLineNumber">08|</span># variable resolution</font>
<span class="clsLineNumber">08|</span><font color="0000FF">jclds      </font>=<font color="0000FF"> $(hlq).JCL</font>
<span class="clsLineNumber">09|</span>
<span class="clsLineNumber">10|</span><font color="008000"># immediate assignment using :=
<span class="clsLineNumber">11|</span># this statement refers to a variable with delayed assignment which
<span class="clsLineNumber">12|</span># means $(jclds) is expanded to $(hlq).JCL which then gets resolved
<span class="clsLineNumber">13|</span># to USER1.JCL</font>
<span class="clsLineNumber">14|</span><font color="0000FF">someds    </font>:=<font color="0000FF"> $(jclds)</font>
<span class="clsLineNumber">15|</span>
<span class="clsLineNumber">16|</span><font color="008000"># delayed assignment using =</font>
<span class="clsLineNumber">17|</span><font color="0000FF">hlq        </font>=<font color="0000FF"> USER2</font>
<span class="clsLineNumber">18|</span>
<span class="clsLineNumber">19|</span><font color="008000"># immediate conditional assignment using ?=
<span class="clsLineNumber">20|</span># a conditional assignment only assigns a value if the variable doesn't
<span class="clsLineNumber">21|</span># exist, or already exists but has no value
<span class="clsLineNumber">22|</span># this statement again refers to $(jclds) which again is expanded to
<span class="clsLineNumber">23|</span># $(hlq).JCL but since $(hlq) has been assigned a new value, the result
<span class="clsLineNumber">24|</span># is now USER1.JCL</font>
<span class="clsLineNumber">25|</span><font color="0000FF">anotherds </font>?=<font color="0000FF"> $(jclds)</font>
</div>
<p>
The first sample assignment is the simplest one. The immediate assignment operator <span class="clsMonospace">:=</span> causes any other variables used in the value part of the assignment to be resolved and the result assigned. Although in this first example the value is merely a constant.
</p>
<p>
The second sample assigment demonstrates the use of another variable in the value assigned. In this example the delayed assignment operator <span class="clsMonospace">=</span> is used, which means the variable <span class="clsMonospace">$(hlq)</span> is left unresolved and becomes part of the value as is.
</p>
<p>
The third sample assignment is like the first one, although this one actually demonstrates delayed variable resolution. Again the immediate assignment operator <span class="clsMonospace">:=</span> is used, resulting in any variables used in the value part of the assignment to be resolved. Furthermore this example shows that this is done recursively, so after <span class="clsMonospace">$(jclds)</span> is resolved to <span class="clsMonospace">$(hlq).JCL</span>, variable resolution will keep going since there's still a variable left. Finally the value <span class="clsMonospace">USER1.JCL</span> is assigned.
</p>
<p>
The fourth example is simple there to setup the the last example while in the meantime demonstrating that delayed assignment without using variables in the value works fine too.
</p>
<p>
The fifth sample assignment uses the immediate conditional assignment operator <span class="clsMonospace">?=</span> which causes the resolved value to only be assigned if the variable left of the operator doesn't exist or if it's empty. It also demonstrates how assigning the same <span class="clsMonospace">$(jclds)</span> variable can result in a different value because it in turn was assigned in a delayed assignment.
